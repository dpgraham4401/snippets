// Rust has a strange syntax that feels like a cross between c++ and JavaScript, so beware

// 'main' is always the entrypoint for binary applications.

    // variables declared with let are immutable by default

    // TYPES
    // rust is a statically typed language and has an overkill of types
    // bits     signed  unsigned            // floats, all floats are unsigned
    // 8-bit	i8  	u8                  // 32-bit	___ 	f32 // single precision
    // 16-bit	i16  	u16                 // 64-bit	___ 	f64 // double precision
    // 32-bit	i32 	u32 (standard choice for integer)

    // types are declared with ':' after the variable name, reads nicer than c/c++ bool foo = true;
    let bool_value: bool = true; // rust_fmt expects snake case for most variables
    println!("a boolean value: {}", bool_value);
    let x: f32 = 3.14;
    println!("single precision value: {}", x);

    // Rust has char types, that are Unicode by default
    let z = 'z'; // char literals use single quotes
    let my_string = "string literal"; // string use double quotes (!!!)
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ğŸ˜»';

        z,
        my_string,

    let my_array: [i32; 6] = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for i in 1..my_array.len() {

    println!("this value was returned from a function: {}", x);

    // Rust has expressions that can be evaluated in the body of '{}'
    // lines ending with a ';' are considered statements,
    // lines of a function or expression not ending in a ';' are often used as way of returning a value
    let x = {
        let initial_value = 2 + 2;
        initial_value + 1 // no ';' this value will be returned and assigned to x
    };

        x
    );
}

// Regular functions seem pretty straight forward
fn hello_string(x: &str) {

}

// return values are declared with '->' symbol
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1 // could also have said 'return x + 1;'
