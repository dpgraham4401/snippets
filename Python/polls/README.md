# Polls

This is a demo of the [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) python package, as
documented in their demos page
here https://aiohttp-demos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#aiohttp-demos-polls-getting-started

only difference is i'm not going to set up a db for a demo app.
I want trying to check out aiohttp, not dba.
