### Code for learning, remembering, and reuse

if you're reading this, you must be lost.

I use this repo as a way to make things that I learn stick...
but if they don't this repo also serves as a quick reference for me.
I find if I take pen to paper (or hands to keys I guess) I will actually remember.
